# Updater Version Tracking
This repository is used for the auto dark mode updater. It holds the version files used by the updater to determine if there is a new version.

# Beta Builds
This is also the **official** source for beta zip files. If you find updater zip files here, or your Auto Dark Mode installation is downloading from this repo, that's why.
