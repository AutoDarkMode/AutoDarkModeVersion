# Auto Dark Mode Version & Beta Build Repository
This repository is part of the Auto Dark Mode Project

https://github.com/AutoDarkMode/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode

## Updater Version Tracking
This repository is used for the auto dark mode updater. It holds the version files used by the updater to determine if there is a new version.

## Beta Builds
This is also the **official** source for beta zip files. If you find updater zip files here, or your Auto Dark Mode installation is downloading from this repo, that's why.
